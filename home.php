Ira originally a Brooklynite, which has been the place of his residence since he was born in 1988. Ira got interested in real estate at a young age and dreams of owning property in the NYC area. He is very amazed and excited to see how Brooklyn’s most undesirable neighborhoods have transformed into renters paradises. Ira is a very helpful real estate agent who is known for satisfying his client’s needs often his clients refer him to their friends or family. Ira has a thirst for knowledge in real estate and business; currently a college student studying Computer Information Systems at Baruch, he prides himself on the fact that if there is something he doesn’t know he will go find it out. Don’t think of Ira as a another money hungry broker think of him as a professional match maker who listens to his clients and finds the best solution to their real estate request.
